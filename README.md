### What I learned

I learned in this challenge the importance of well managed states in React. I wanted to use some reactContext but I thought that I could just use state itself and the local storage, since it is much better right. I also learned some other hooks to which I want to use in other projects. I also implemented my own drag and drop  :>>

### Continued development

I want to practice more about React!!
